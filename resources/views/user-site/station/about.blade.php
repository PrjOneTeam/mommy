                            <p>MyTeachingStation.com believes that every child is remarkable, unique, and deserving of the opportunity to learn by using the very best early childhood resources on the planet - no one excluded.</p>
                            <p>Hi, my name is Gisela Meyer, founder and CEO of MyTeachingStation.com. After many years of long hours, late nights, and weekends researching the best early childhood teaching resources available, I have compiled thousands of original educational worksheets, activities, games, tips, and exercises to share and inspire like-minded teachers and parents.</p>
                            <p>Like many of you, as a lifetime learner, my journey started out for the sole purpose of giving my two young boys an edge when it came to their academic pursuits - one that I never had when growing up.</p>
                            <p>After deciding to homeschool for the first time, I struggled to find resources that were complete, engaging, clear, and most importantly, correct.</p>
                            <p>Frankly, I was a bit puzzled by my slim findings of quality resources. I decided to develop a personalized collection of sound teaching materials that I knew others would need, appreciate, and trust.</p>
                            <h4 class="mto mbo">Your Free Early Childhood Educational Resources</h4>
                            <p>Birthed from the desire to connect with other teachers of the same mind, I began to share my collection online, which led to a local circulation and eventually spread like wildfire across the nation resulting in a thriving international community.</p>
                            <p>Today, MyTeachingStation.com brings you original, relevant resources conceived from the practical real-world educational needs we see daily in our diverse audience.</p>
